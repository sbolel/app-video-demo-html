* To capture a mobile demo video of a web app on OS X,
    - Use [Chrome DevTools to emulate an iPhone 6](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/setup/device-testing/devtools-emulator).
    - Use [QuickTime Player to record the portion of the screen](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH5882?locale=en_US) that shows your web app.
